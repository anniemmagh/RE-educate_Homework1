      Bitcoin (abbreviation: BTC<sup>[a]</sup> or XBT<sup>[b]</sup>; sign: â‚¿) is a protocol which
      implements a highly available, public, permanent, and decentralized
      ledger. In order to add to the ledger, a user must prove they control an
      entry in the ledger. The protocol specifies that the entry indicates an
      amount of a token, bitcoin with a minuscule b. The user can update the
      ledger, assigning some of their bitcoin to another entry in the ledger.
      Because the token has characteristics of money, it can be thought of as a
      digital currency.[10]
